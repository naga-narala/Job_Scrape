## Best Practices for Code Review

Before implementing any feature or fix, I will:

- Ask clarifying questions about requirements and edge cases but not silly and foolish questions
- Identify potential failure points and error scenarios
- Validate assumptions about data, inputs, and system behavior
- Review for performance, security, and scalability concerns
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage and documentation

This approach ensures production-ready code that handles real-world complexity and reduces bugs.
