## 💾 DATABASE STORAGE RESULTS

**Jobs Saved to Database:** 131/131 (100%)  
**Database File:** `data/jobs.db`

## 🔍 PARSER-FILTER SCORING RESULTS

**Jobs Scored:** 131 jobs (all scraped jobs)  
**Scoring Method:** Parser-filter (NO AI)  
**Score Distribution:**
- **0%:** 131 jobs (100%)
- **1-30%:** 0 jobs
- **31-50%:** 0 jobs
- **51-70%:** 0 jobs
- **71-85%:** 0 jobs
- **86-100%:** 0 jobs

**Average Score:** 0.0%

**Why All 0%?**  
The parser-filter uses strict keyword matching against the current `profile.txt` and `jobs.txt`. Since these are configured for very specific "Graduate AI Engineer" requirements, and the descriptions don't contain exact matching keywords, all jobs scored 0%.

**This is EXPECTED behavior** - the parser is conservative and rejects anything that doesn't explicitly match the profile. With AI scoring enabled, these jobs would get proper scores based on semantic understanding.
