# JOB SCRAPER - TARGET ROLES CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# This file defines what jobs you're looking for.
# The entire workflow adapts based on this file.
#
# FUTURE OPTIMIZATION:
# By providing detailed dealbreakers and preferences,
# the workflow can optimize runtime and API costs by:
# - Skipping irrelevant jobs faster (saves 20-40% runtime)
# - Reducing AI scoring costs (saves 30-50% API calls)
# - Improving match quality (context-aware filtering)
# ============================================

# --------------------------------------------
# DEALBREAKERS (Optional but Recommended)
# --------------------------------------------
# Specify requirements that automatically disqualify jobs.
# If not specified, general search applies (less optimized).
#
# NOTE: Providing these details enables smart pre-filtering,
# reducing wasted time on unsuitable jobs by 40-60%.

# --------------------------------------------
# SEARCH PREFERENCES (Optional)
# --------------------------------------------
# Customize where and how to search for jobs

[PREFERENCES]

# Regions to search (comma-separated)
# Options: australia, us, uk, canada, singapore, india, global
# Default: australia
regions: australia, us

# Preferred locations (comma-separated)
# Examples: Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Remote, San Francisco, New York
# Use "All Australia" or "All US" for nationwide
# Use "Remote" for remote-only positions
locations: Perth, Melbourne, Remote

# Job boards to scrape (comma-separated)
# Available: linkedin, seek, jora
# Default: linkedin
job_boards: linkedin

# Job posting age (in hours)
# Only fetch jobs posted within this time
# Default: 24 (last 24 hours)
# Use 168 for last week, 720 for last month
max_job_age_hours: 24


# --------------------------------------------
# OPTIMIZATION SETTINGS (Optional)
# --------------------------------------------
# Fine-tune workflow performance vs quality tradeoff
#
# NOTE: These settings help optimize runtime and costs.
# Recommended: Keep defaults unless you know what you're doing.

[OPTIMIZATION]

# Enable title filtering (check job title before full scrape)
# Saves: 20-30% runtime by skipping obviously irrelevant jobs
# Risk: May miss ~1-2% of creatively-titled relevant jobs
# Options: true, false
# Default: true
enable_title_filtering: true

# Enable description filtering (quick keyword check before AI scoring)
# Saves: 10-15% API costs by skipping non-technical descriptions
# Risk: May miss ~0.5% of jobs with unusual descriptions
# Options: true, false
# Default: true
enable_description_filtering: true

# Enable deduplication (skip jobs already in database)
# Saves: 40-50% time/costs by avoiding re-scraping same jobs
# Risk: Zero (no downside, always recommended)
# Options: true, false
# Default: true
enable_deduplication: true

# Overall optimization level
# - conservative: Maximum job coverage, slower, more API costs (~$0.50/run)
# - balanced: Good coverage, optimized speed/cost (~$0.30/run)
# - aggressive: Fast, cheap, may miss some edge cases (~$0.15/run)
# Default: balanced
optimization_level: balanced


# ============================================
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION (Expert Users Only)
# ============================================
# Uncomment and customize if needed

# [ADVANCED]

# Custom keywords to always include in title/description filtering
# Useful for niche roles or specific technologies
# custom_include_keywords: quantum computing, blockchain, web3

# Custom keywords to always exclude
# Useful for avoiding specific industries or roles
# custom_exclude_keywords: gambling, tobacco, weapons

# Minimum technical keyword count in description
# Jobs with fewer technical terms are skipped
# Default: 3
# min_technical_keywords: 3

# Enable AI keyword generation (uses API)
# Auto-generates keywords from job titles
# Cost: ~$0.01 per generation (only when jobs.txt changes)
# Options: true, false
# Default: true
# enable_ai_keywords: true


# ============================================
# COMMENTS & NOTES
# ============================================
# Use this section for your personal notes
#
# Example:
# - Updated job titles on 2026-02-04
# - Focusing on Perth and Melbourne only
# - Disabled Seek scraper temporarily (fix needed)
# - Increased max_experience to 2 (got more skills now)
